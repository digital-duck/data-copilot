# Problem

```
This is a RAG app for Data Analyst I built last year using streamlit comletely (for both backend and frontend), it works nicely for a small use-base.

But to scale it up, I start looking into FastAPI and javascript frontend such as vue.js or alpine.js

I like to hear your suggestions on how to upgrade it to become a web app to be deployed to AWS using ECS

Please just do a code analysis and migration planning, no need to refactor code yet,

Let me know if you find any bug and improvement within current framework
```

# Solution

Completed initial code analysis and understanding of the Streamlit application, its core components, and data flow. Identified key dependencies and areas for improvement.

Detailed plan for migrating the backend to FastAPI, including API endpoint design, business logic extraction, authentication, configuration management, Vanna AI integration, database interaction, error handling, and background tasks. Emphasized fixing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Detailed plan for migrating the frontend to JavaScript (Vue.js recommended), covering component design, API integration, state management, UI/UX, plotting, and routing. Mapped Streamlit widgets to potential Vue.js component implementations.

Detailed plan for AWS ECS deployment, including containerization for backend and frontend, ECS Fargate configuration, networking with ALB, database options (SQLite with EFS vs. RDS), secrets management, CI/CD pipeline, and logging/monitoring. Recommended RDS for scalability.

Recommended a phased migration approach, starting with critical backend fixes and foundational work, followed by core backend API development, frontend development, initial AWS deployment with EFS, and finally, production hardening with RDS and CI/CD, before decommissioning the old app.

Outlined the 'Documentation and Reporting' step, covering architecture documentation, API specifications, frontend component guides, deployment procedures for AWS ECS, operational runbooks, a user guide, and a summary report detailing the migration and improvements made.

Summary
Add comprehensive migration plan for Data Copilot This plan details the migration of the Streamlit-based Data Copilot application to a FastAPI backend and a JavaScript frontend, with deployment to AWS ECS. Key aspects covered: - Analysis of the current Streamlit application. - Detailed planning for backend (FastAPI) development, including API design, business logic extraction, authentication, and database interaction. Addressed critical SQL injection vulnerabilities. - Detailed planning for frontend (Vue.js/Alpine.js) development, including component design, API integration, state management, and UI/UX considerations. - Comprehensive AWS ECS deployment strategy, covering containerization, networking, database migration (SQLite to RDS), secrets management, CI/CD, and monitoring. - A phased migration approach to manage complexity and risk. - Requirements for documentation and reporting post-migration.
