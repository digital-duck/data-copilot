The IMDB dataset	gravitates around the notion of a title. It is the primary entity. The title ID is what you see in the URL when you visit imdb.com. It is the defacto ID that other movie and TV sites use to uniquely reference a movie or show. So a bit of clarification on that ID and how the tables in the dataset reference it is in order.		
Title	A movie has a title, a TV show has one. An episode has one as well. Well two actually; the title of the show, and the title of the episode itself. That is why there are two links to the same title_id attribute in the titles table.
