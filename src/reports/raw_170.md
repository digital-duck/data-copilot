### Question: 
#### in jupyter notebook, how to show a plotly figure in place


### Answer

To display a Plotly figure directly within a Jupyter Notebook cell, you need to use the `plotly.io` module. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. **Install Plotly**: If you haven't already installed Plotly, you can do so using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install plotly
   ```

2. **Import Necessary Libraries**: Import the required libraries in your Jupyter Notebook cell.
   ```python
   import plotly.graph_objs as go
   from plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot
   ```

3. **Initialize Plotly for Jupyter**: This step is necessary to enable inline plotting in Jupyter notebooks.
   ```python
   init_notebook_mode(connected=True)
   ```

4. **Create a Plotly Figure**: Create your Plotly figure using `go.Figure` or any other method you prefer.
   ```python
   fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6])])
   ```

5. **Display the Figure**: Use the `iplot` function to display the figure directly in the notebook cell.
   ```python
   iplot(fig)
   ```

Here's a complete example:

```python
import plotly.graph_objs as go
from plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot

# Initialize Plotly for Jupyter
init_notebook_mode(connected=True)

# Create a sample figure
fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6])])

# Display the figure in the notebook
iplot(fig)
```

When you run this code in a Jupyter Notebook cell, it will display the Plotly figure directly within the cell.
